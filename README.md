# SpellSprint

## Introduction
Hello everyone, we are the creators of the game SpellSprint, and today we intend to present our game to you.

Have you ever thought about testing your mind and linguistic abilities in a fun and engaging way? If so, then you are in the right place. Today, we will introduce you to a game that will not only entertain you but also challenge your skills.

## Game Description
Imagine being faced with a board of letters, a random mix of vowels and consonants. What will your task be? It's very simple: you have to find the perfect answer hidden among those seemingly random characters.

Sounds simple, right? But be careful, you will have a limited number of attempts, and if you feel confident, you can try the EXTREME mode, which gives you only one attempt.

You will be instantly immersed in a vibrant and action-packed world.
We are in a futuristic environment where the colors vary based on the mode chosen by the player. As you can see from the initial screen, a road leads us directly to the futuristic city, and the car present here will go straight there, where our game will begin. This car represents our player, who embarks on this new adventure, putting all their skills to the test.
